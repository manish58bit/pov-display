# POV Display

This project demonstrates a **Persistence of Vision (POV)** display that shows the text `"JAI HIND"` using 10 LEDs mounted on a rotating arm, controlled by an **Arduino Nano** and triggered by a **Hall effect sensor**.

## ðŸ§  How it Works

- A Hall effect sensor detects the magnet on each rotation.
- Arduino triggers the LED pattern based on timing.
- The pattern is displayed column by column creating the illusion of full characters using POV.
